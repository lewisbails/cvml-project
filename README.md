Transfer Learning for Fine-grained Multi-class Classification of Macroinvertebrate

This is a project completed as part of a computer vision and machine learning course at Aarhus University. The project concerned the classification of macroinvertebrate using a pre-trained CNN base model with several top model classifiers, with a comparison of the results achieved with each. The paper for the project has been included in the repository.
